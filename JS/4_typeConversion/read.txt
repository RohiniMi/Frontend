### Objective:

Understand and demonstrate the use of type conversions in JavaScript. This includes implicit and explicit conversions between strings, numbers, and booleans.

### Instructions:

- Write your code in a JavaScript (.js) file.
- Clearly comment on each task explaining the expected type conversion.
- Test your code to ensure each part functions as expected.
- Use `console.log()` to print the results and outcomes of each task.

### Tasks:

### Part 1: Implicit Type Conversion (Coercion)

1. **String to Number**:
    - Add a number to a string and store the result in a variable.
    - Log the variable and comment on what type of conversion occurred.
2. **Boolean to String**:
    - Use a boolean in a string context (e.g., concatenation) and observe the result.
    - Print the result and explain the conversion that took place.
3. **Number to Boolean**:
    - Use a number in a boolean context (e.g., in an `if` statement) and describe which numbers convert to `true` or `false`.

### Part 2: Explicit Type Conversion

1. **Using `String()`**:
    - Convert a number and a boolean to a string using `String()`.
    - Log the results and the types before and after the conversion.
2. **Using `Number()`**:
    - Convert a string numeric value and a boolean to a number using `Number()`.
    - Log the results and the types before and after the conversion.
    - Attempt to convert a non-numeric string to a number and log the result.
3. **Using `Boolean()`**:
    - Convert various values (0, 1, "", "hello", `null`, and `undefined`) to boolean using `Boolean()`.
    - Log each result and explain the conversion rule that applies.

### Submission:

Submit your `.js` file with clearly commented tasks and printed results for each part of the assignment.
