1. **Basic Timeout:**
    - Write a simple `setTimeout()` call that logs a message to the console after a delay of 3 seconds.
2. **Clearing Timeout:**
    - Create a `setTimeout()` that is meant to log a message to the console after a 5-second delay. However, before the message is logged, clear the timeout, so the code never runs.
3. **Arguments in `setTimeout()`:**
    - Pass additional arguments to the `setTimeout()` callback function and log them to the console.
4. **Recurring Timeout:**
    - Instead of using `setInterval()`, use `setTimeout()` within a function to create a recurring timeout that logs a message to the console every 2 seconds.
