### Objective:

Demonstrate your understanding of JavaScript strings, boolean values, and the `typeof` operator by completing the tasks below.

### Instructions:

- Write your code in a JavaScript (.js) file.
- Comment each section of your code to describe what it does.
- Test your code to make sure each part works correctly.
- Use `console.log()` to print the results of each task.

### Tasks:

### Part 1: String Operations

1. **String Creation**:
    - Create a string variable using single quotes.
    - Create another string variable using double quotes.
    - Create a third string variable using template literals (backticks).
2. **String Concatenation**:
    - Combine the three - strings from the first task into one new string.
- Print the combined string to the console.

### Part 2: Boolean Logic

**True or False**:

- Initialize a boolean variable with a `true` value and another with a `false` value.
- Print both values to the console.

### Part 3: The `typeof` Operator

**Type Checking**:

- Use `typeof` to check the data types of the following and print each result:
    - A string
    - A number
    - A boolean
    - An object
    - A symbol
    - An undefined variable
### Submission:

Submit your `.js` file with all tasks properly commented and outputs visible in the console.
