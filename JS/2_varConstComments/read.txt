### Objective:

Demonstrate comprehension of JavaScript variables, constants, and comments through practical tasks.

## **Task 1: Variable Declarations**

1. **Create Variables**:
    - Declare a variable using `let` to store a string.
    - Declare a variable using `const` to store a number.
    - Declare another variable using `var` to store a boolean value.
    - Comment on the significance of each type of variable declaration.
2. **Variable Manipulation**:
    - Reassign a new value to the `let` variable.
    - Attempt to reassign a new value to the `const` variable and observe the result.
    - Explain the implications of using `const` for variables.

## **Task 2: Constants and Comments**

1.1. **Constants and Values**:
    - Create a constant using `const` to store a string.
    - Attempt to reassign a new value to the constant and observe the output.
    - Describe the difference between constants and variables in JavaScript.
2. **Comments in Code**:
    - Use single-line comments to explain the purpose of each variable and constant.
    - Use multi-line comments to provide an overview of the code section and its functionality.
