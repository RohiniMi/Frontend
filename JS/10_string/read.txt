### Assignment of Day 46 : Strings

### Objective:

To understand the fundamentals of string manipulation in JavaScript, including creating strings, concatenating them, and applying various string methods.

### Instructions:

- Write your code in a JavaScript (.js) file.
- Comment your code to describe what each section achieves.
- Test your code with different inputs to verify correctness.
- Output the results using `console.log()`.

### Tasks:

### Part 1: String Creation

1. **String Variables**:
    - Create a string variable named `greeting` that contains the phrase "Hello, World!".
    - Log this string to the console.

### Part 2: Basic String Operations

1. **Concatenation**:
    - Create two string variables, `firstName` and `lastName`.
    - Concatenate them into a third variable `fullName` and log it to the console.
2. **Length Property**:
    - Log the length of the `fullName` string to the console.

### Part 3: String Methods

1. **Finding a Substring**:
    - Find the index of the first occurrence of the letter "a" in the `fullName` and log it to the console.
2. **Slicing a String**:
    - Extract the first name from the `fullName` string using the `slice()` method and log it to the console.
3. **Replacing String Content**:
    - Replace "Hello" in the `greeting` string with "Goodbye" and log the new string to the console.
4. **Converting to Upper and Lower Case**:
    - Log `fullName` in uppercase and then in lowercase.

### Part 4: Comparing Strings

1. **Equality Check**:
    - Check if `greeting` is equal to "Hello, World!" and log the result (true or false).
2. **Case-Insensitive Comparison**:
    - Compare `greeting` to "hello, world!" in a case-insensitive manner and log whether they are equal.

### Submission:

Submit your `.js` file with the completed tasks, comments, and outputs verified with `console.log()`. Make sure each method is tested with different strings to ensure robustness.
