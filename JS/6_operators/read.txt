### Objective:

To understand and apply various JavaScript operators including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise, string, and special operators.

### Instructions:

- Write your code in a JavaScript (.js) file.
- Comment on each task explaining what the code does and the outcome.
- Test your code to ensure it functions as expected.
- Use `console.log()` to print the results of your operations.

### Tasks:

### Part 1: Arithmetic Operators
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**:
    - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with two numbers.
    - Find the remainder of the division of two numbers using the modulus operator.
2. **Unary Negation and Plus**:
    - Use unary negation to negate the value of a numeric variable.
    - Use unary plus to convert a string into a number.
3. **Increment/Decrement**:
    - Demonstrate the difference between pre and post-increment/decrement operations.

### Part 2: Assignment Operators

1. **Simple Assignment**:
    - Assign values to variables using simple assignment and log the variables.
2. **Combined Assignment Operators**:
    - Use combined assignment operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus and log the results.
### Part 3: Comparison Operators

1. **Equality Comparisons**:
    - Compare two variables using both the equality (==) and strict equality (===) operators and explain the difference.
2. **Relational Operators**:
    - Use greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to compare two variables.

### Part 4: Logical Operators

1. **AND, OR, NOT**:
    - Use logical AND, OR, and NOT to combine Boolean expressions and log the outcomes.

### Part 5: Bitwise Operators

1. **AND, OR, XOR, NOT**:
    - Apply bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT to numbers and log the binary results.

### Part 6: String Operators

1. **Concatenation**:
    - Use the concatenation operator (+) to combine two strings.
2. **Concatenation with Assignment**:
    - Combine two strings using the concatenation assignment operator (+=).

### Submission:

Submit your `.js` file with clearly commented tasks and printed results for each part of the assignment. Your comments should explain the purpose of the code and the results of the operations.
