### Assignment of Day 43 : Conditions

### Objective:

To grasp the usage of conditional statements in JavaScript and apply them to make decisions within a program.

### Instructions:

- Implement your code in a JavaScript `(.js)` file.
- Clearly comment on each task to describe what the code is intended to do.
- Verify your code by testing different scenarios and ensure it behaves as expected.
- Display the output of your code using `console.log()`.

### Tasks:

### Part 1: If Statement

1. **Simple If**:
    - Write a condition that checks if a number is positive and logs a message if true.
2. **If-Else**:
    - Extend the above condition to log a different message if the number is not positive.

### Part 2: If-Else If Statement

1. **Multiple Conditions**:
    - Write a set of conditions that will check if a number is positive, negative, or zero and log an appropriate message for each case.

### Part 3: Nested If Statement

1. **Nested Conditions**:
    - Write a nested if statement that checks two conditions: first, if a string is of a certain length, and if true, checks if it contains a specific character.

### Part 4: Switch Statement

1. **Basic Switch**:
    - Use a switch statement to log a message based on the value of a variable representing a day of the week.
2. **Switch with Default**:
    - Include a default case that will handle any values that don't match a case explicitly defined.

### Part 5: Conditional (Ternary) Operator

1. **Simple Ternary**:
    - Use the ternary operator to assign a message to a variable based on a boolean condition and log it.

### Part 6: Truthy and Falsy Values

1. **Understanding Truthy and Falsy**:
    - Write an if statement that checks the truthiness or falsiness of a variable and logs a message accordingly.

### Submission:

Submit your `.js` file with all the tasks clearly commented and the output for each printed using `console.log()`. Ensure that your comments articulate the logic behind using each type of conditional statement.
