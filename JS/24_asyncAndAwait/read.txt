1. **Understanding async Functions:**
    - Create a function declared with the `async` keyword that returns a string. Observe how it implicitly returns a Promise.
2. **Implementing await:**
    - Inside an `async` function, use the `await` keyword to wait for a Promise to resolve and print the resolved value to the console.
3. **Error Handling in async/await:**
    - Demonstrate how to catch errors in `async/await` using `try/catch` blocks by intentionally causing a Promise to reject.
4. **Refactoring Promises to async/await:**
    - Take an existing piece of code that uses `.then()` and `.catch()` and refactor it to use `async/await`.
